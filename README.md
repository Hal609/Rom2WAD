# OoT-WAD-Injector

Note that this program is meant for Windows users.


Make sure you have went through the process of creating a Randomized OoT.z64 ROM before using this program as it will be needed.


Tutorial on how to make a Randomized OoT.z64 ROM can be found here: https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer
Just scroll down and you will see the instructions.


To use this tool, you will need the following:
-Original NTSC-U OoT 1.2 WAD (Google it)
-GZinject (https://github.com/krimtonz/gzinject/releases)
-Compressed OoT Randomized ROM (32,768 KB)  *The 65,536 KB ROM will not work on the Wii*


Make sure EVERYTHING is extracted (not in a .zip or .rar folder), otherwise it will not work.


You can set a WAD title if you want, by default this will be "OoT Randomized".
This title will be reflected when you hover the channel on your Wii.
*Keep in mind that the title can not exceed 20 characters* (You can't anyway even if you tried since the text box lenght is 20 Characters).


Special thanks to @WooAf and @RizeYuzuki for making this tool.
